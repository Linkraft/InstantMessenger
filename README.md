# InstantMessenger
Peer-to-peer instant messenger (IM) program I developed for my Computer Information and Security class at the University of Florida. There are three interations of the IM: unencrypted, encrypted, and encrypted via the [Diffie-Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange). They are separated into their own branches to give you an idea of how the program developed and became more secure over time.

## Dependencies
Python 2.7 (but will probably work with later versions)
PyCryptodome 3.9.0

## Usage
Each branch has a PDF detailing the intended usage of the program. Please refer to them for information on how to use each program.

## Acknowledgements
The code for both encrypted programs was built on top of a base provided by my professor, UF's Kevin Butler, and an .
